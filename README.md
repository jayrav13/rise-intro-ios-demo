# RISE Weekend

To set up:
 - Open Terminal. Use the `cd` (change directory) command to move to a folder in which you'd like to store this project.
 - In Terminal, consider using the `mkdir` (make directory) command to create a folder to organize projects.
 - Run `git clone https://github.com/jayrav13/rise-intro-ios-demo.git` to pull this repo. It will create a folder called `rise-intro-ios-demo`.
 - Run `cd rise-intro-ios-demo` to move into this project's directory.
 - To install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), run `pod init`. Following installation, you should see a message similar to the following: `Pod installation complete! There are 2 dependencies from the Podfile and 2 total pods installed.`
 - Type `open RISE-Demo-App.xcworkspace`. This will open Xcode with this project.

More to come soon!
